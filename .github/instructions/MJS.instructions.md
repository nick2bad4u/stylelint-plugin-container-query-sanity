# JavaScript Modules (.mjs)

These guidelines focus ESM-first JavaScript using `.mjs` files. These aren't hard rules, but rather recommendations to improve consistency, readability, and maintainability across projects using modern MJS JavaScript.

## Module Style

### Imports and Exports

-   Use **ES modules exclusively** (`import` / `export`), no `require` / `module.exports`.
-   Prefer **named exports** for libraries and utilities:
-   Default exports only when there is a single primary concept.

### Syntax

-   Always use `const` when variables are not reassigned, `let` otherwise; avoid `var`.
-   Prefer **arrow functions** for short callbacks and inline functions; use `function` declarations for named, reusable logic.
-   Use template literals (`` `...${value}...` ``) instead of string concatenation.
-   Prefer destructuring for objects and arrays when it improves clarity.
-   Keep `.mjs` modules compatible with strict checking and prefer JSDoc type annotations for public helpers.

### Async and Promises

-   Use `async` / `await` for asynchronous workflows.
-   Handle errors explicitly with `try`/`catch` or by returning structured error results.
-   Keep async side effects (I/O, network, filesystem) close to the boundary of your module; keep pure logic separate.

### Types and Documentation

-   Prefer JSDoc type annotations or `.d.ts` files for `.mjs` modules.
-   Document public functions and exports with concise JSDoc comments explaining purpose and parameters.
-   Repository conventions:
	-   Target the repository runtime baseline for root `.mjs` tooling. If the repo declares a specific Node.js floor (for example Node.js `>=22.0.0`) and ES output target, match that baseline.
	-   Use the `node:`-prefixed built-ins and `import.meta.url` + `fileURLToPath` when you need `__dirname`-style resolution.
	-   Keep modules compatible with the repository's JS/TS checking config (for example `tsconfig.js.json`, if present) so the local typecheck and lint workflows succeed without extra config.
